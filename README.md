# Shooting Stars
Provides a way to crowdsource shooting star information through an external server.
The following information is sent to the server when you have looked through a telescope:
* World
* Location of the star
* Minimum and maximum time for the star to land
* Keyword used to store your data

The default server does not encrypt any of your data, and only stores the above data.

## Shared keys
The key set in the plugin config must be 1-10 alpha characters (a-z, A-Z). You can share this key with others so you can see each
other's scouted stars.
